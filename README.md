  <p>Relay is a tool to tunnel iOS sockets to your local machine through a USB tunnel.</p>
</h3>

‚ö†Ô∏è This is an experimental project and might make your app crash. Do not use on production builds.

üíï Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

## How it works

### Client-side (iOS)

Relay will create one or more sockets listening on an arbitrary, user-specified port. All the communication in that port will be forwarded to and from your computer through a USB connection.

### Server-side (macOS)

When running on your machine, Relay will listen for connections over USB and route the client's traffic to and from localhost at the requested port.

## Installing

### Client-side (iOS)

_If you'd rather install manually, check [ExampleRelayClient](https://github.com/igorlira/relay/blob/master/ExampleRelayClient) for an example._

Relay is available on CocoaPods. Add the following line on your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'RelayClient', '0.0.1-alpha1'
```

After running `pod install`, Add the following lines to your AppDelegate.m:

```diff
+#import <RelayClient/RelayConnectionManager.h>

 @interface AppDelegate ()

+@property (nonatomic, strong) RelayConnectionManager* relayManager;

 @end
 
 - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
+    self.relayManager = [[RelayConnectionManager alloc] init];

+    // Use hangIfNotConnected to prevent incoming connections from being refused if we're not connected over USB
+    self.relayManager.hangIfNotConnected = YES;

+    // Will relay iOS(localhost:80) to macOS(localhost:8081)
+    [self.relayManager addLocalPort:@(80) relayPort:@(8081)];

+    [self.relayManager start];
 }

 - (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {
+    [self.relayManager stop];
 }


 - (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application {
+    [self.relayManager start];
 }
```

‚úÖ Done!

### Server-side (macOS)

You can either build the target `RelayServer` directly from the source code, or download a precompiled version [here](https://github.com/igorlira/relay/raw/master/RelayServer-macOS.dmg).

Relay will add an icon to your menu bar indicating if it's connected to a device:
